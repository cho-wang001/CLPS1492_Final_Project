# CLPS1492_Final_Project
Feedback and Feedforward Projections between V1 and IT cortex

The object recognition model we considered in class considered only bidirectional connections between each level of the hierarchy and the one above/below it, while the anatomy suggests that there are also projections from lower levels that project to higher levels (ie direct projections from V1 and V4/IT and back). Add these connections with different types of topographies and explore their influence on the modelâ€™s object recognition.
